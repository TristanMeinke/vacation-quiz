# vacation-quiz
### For my second code review at Epicodus:

I created this quiz which asks the user a series of questions to predict where they should go on vacation.  Though this site is basically a buzzfeed quiz in structure, it does demonstrate my abilities to use JavaScript and jQuery to implement client side changes to a site.

At present, the algorithm is dependent upon the user not pressing a single button more than once, but since that was not a part of the assignment, I did not implement this error control.  Beyond that, just answer the questions and find out where you're going!
